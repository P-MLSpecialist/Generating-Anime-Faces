# Generating-Anime-Faces

The challenge is to create high-quality anime faces that embody the anime art style while aiming for realism and appeal. To achieve this goal, we utilized the Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN) algorithm.
The project has successfully generated compelling anime faces that showcase the realism achieved with DCGAN. The project provides real and generated image examples, which contribute to anime art. This project is a valuable resource for researchers, artists, and fans alike!
